# HelioSuite Development Scratchpad

## Background and Motivation

HelioSuite is an AI-powered SaaS platform designed specifically for solar installation companies in South Africa. The platform addresses the fragmented tooling landscape by providing a unified solution that streamlines:

- Lead tracking and CRM management
- AI-powered proposal generation using GPT-4-turbo and LangChain
- Field operations with offline-first mobile app for technicians
- Project management and billing workflows

The platform is built on Firebase infrastructure with React web dashboard, React Native mobile app, and integrated AI services. The initial target market is small-to-medium solar installation businesses in South Africa, with plans for regional expansion.

**Key Technical Foundation:**
- Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Hosting
- React + TailwindCSS for web dashboard
- React Native (Expo) for mobile app with offline-first architecture
- OpenAI + LangChain for AI proposal generation
- Role-based access control (Admin, Technician, Sales Rep, Owner)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**1. Offline-First Mobile Architecture**
- Challenge: Field technicians often work in areas with poor connectivity
- Solution: IndexedDB local storage with intelligent sync manager
- Critical: Conflict resolution for concurrent offline updates

**2. AI Proposal Generation (HelioSense)**
- Challenge: Converting project data to professional solar proposals
- Solution: Structured prompts + LangChain + GPT-4-turbo pipeline
- Critical: Token budgeting and cost control

**3. Multi-Role Security Model**
- Challenge: Different access levels for various user types
- Solution: Firebase RBAC with custom claims and Firestore security rules
- Critical: Scoped data access per user role

**4. Real-time Data Synchronization**
- Challenge: Web dashboard and mobile app need consistent data
- Solution: Firestore real-time listeners with offline queue management
- Critical: Data consistency across platforms

**5. Scalable Architecture for MVP to Enterprise**
- Challenge: Start with MVP but design for regional expansion
- Solution: Modular Firebase-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Critical: Performance optimization and cost management

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

*No current blockers or assistance requests.*

## Lessons

1. **Documentation First**: The comprehensive documentation provided excellent foundation for understanding project requirements and technical architecture.
2. **Firebase MCP Integration**: Having Firebase MCP available will streamline configuration and deployment processes.
3. **Offline-First Priority**: The mobile app's offline capability is critical for field operations and must be implemented early.
4. **Security by Design**: RBAC and data protection must be built into the foundation, not added later.
5. **Modular Architecture**: Following the documented standards for folder structure and component organization will ensure maintainability.
