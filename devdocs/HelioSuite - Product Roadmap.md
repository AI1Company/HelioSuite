HelioSuite's product roadmap is strategically designed for rapid iteration and scalability, employing a phased release approach. This plan prioritizes the delivery of core functionalities first, followed by a gradual expansion to include advanced features and achieve global reach.

**1\. Initial Development & Launch Phases**

The initial roadmap is meticulously structured around a series of closely timed milestones, all leading up to the public launch of HelioSuite:

* **Internal Alpha (August 2025):** This crucial phase is dedicated to comprehensive quality assurance (QA) conducted by the entire team. The primary objective is to ensure the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is robustly built. Key technologies integrated during this stage include Firebase for backend services, LangChain for advanced language model applications, and the development of the foundational mobile application.  
* **Pilot Launch (September â€“ October 2025):** The goal of the pilot launch is to onboard three carefully selected pilot customers into the production environment. This phase also aims to secure 15 Letters of Intent (LOIs) from installers for the pilot program and to build a waitlist of over 50 interested users through an early landing page. A key success metric for the pilot partners is the completion of at least three AI-generated proposals using the HelioSuite platform.  
* **MVP Launch (November 2025):** This marks a significant milestone with the public launch of the mobile application on app stores and the activation of billing functionalities. The MVP of HelioSuite will encompass a mobile-first Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform, an AI-powered proposal generation engine, and an intuitive admin portal for efficient job tracking, communication, and documentation. The core features of v1 include a comprehensive CRM with functionalities for leads, jobs, and customer management, alongside a product library; an AI Proposal Generator leveraging LangChain, OpenAI, and Firestore; an offline-first mobile app designed for field technician workflows; a project dashboard offering timeline, invoicing, and status tracking capabilities; and an admin portal for streamlined client communication and quote management. A limited paid rollout is anticipated for Q4 2025\.  
* **Paid Tiers Launch (Q1 2026):** Following the successful MVP launch, Q1 2026 will see the full launch of HelioSuite's paid subscription plans, offering various tiers to cater to different user needs.

**2\. Strategic Expansion & Growth**

Beyond the initial launch, the roadmap outlines ambitious plans for significant expansion and feature enhancements:

* **Globalization (Q1 2026):** This phase will introduce internationalization (i18n) support, allowing the platform to adapt to diverse languages and regional nuances. Stripe billing will be enabled for USD and MXN, facilitating international transactions. HelioSuite is designed to be fully multilingual and globally scalable, with a strong focus on adapting to various languages, tones, and regional requirements. A key aspect of this strategy is localized onboarding for en-ZA (English \- South Africa) and es-MX (Spanish \- Mexico).  
* **Expansion Phase (2026):** HelioSuite aims to substantially expand its user base during 2026, targeting 350 monthly active installers.  
* **Full Localization \+ AI Usage Growth (2027):** By 2027, the platform anticipates reaching 1,000 monthly active installers. This growth will be accompanied by a continued focus on comprehensive localization efforts and an increased adoption of HelioSuite's AI features.  
* **Entry into LATAM & APAC (2028):** The long-term vision for HelioSuite includes strategic expansion into the emerging markets of Latin America (LATAM) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) by 2028, with a target of 2,000 monthly active installers in these regions.

**3\. Milestones Tied to Funding**

The product roadmap is intricately linked to specific funding tranches, ensuring financial support for key development stages:

* **$150,000 Funding:** This initial funding tranche is tied to achieving the MVP live status and successfully onboarding the initial three pilot customers.  
* **$300,000 Funding:** The second funding milestone will enable the launch of Stripe billing and the full deployment of the mobile application.  
* **$450,000 Funding:** This funding level is critical for expanding HelioSuite's operations into South Africa and securing 100 paid users in that region.  
* **$600,000 Funding:** The final funding tranche will facilitate the full AI rollout across the platform and prepare HelioSuite for a Series A funding round, signaling significant growth and investment potential.

**4\. Key Features & Planned Enhancements**

While v1 focuses on establishing core functionalities, HelioSuite has a clear vision for future enhancements:

* **Included in v1:**  
  * **CRM & Admin Dashboard:** This central hub will offer robust lead management, efficient job scheduling, detailed customer profiles, a dynamic product selection engine, a flexible prompt builder, and AI-powered proposal generation leveraging OpenAI. It will also include offline synchronization capabilities, job image upload, job completion submission, new lead notifications, and job due reminders.  
  * **AI Proposal Generator:** This powerful tool will convert project data into professional PDF solar proposals using LangChain and GPT-4-turbo. The proposals will include crucial elements such as savings projections, panel estimates, and visually engaging sections. The generator will also feature input data enrichment for automatically completing assumptions, streamlining the proposal creation process.  
  * **Mobile App (Technician):** Designed for field technicians, the mobile app will feature offline capabilities, allowing access to job details, photo uploads, and seamless syncing once reconnected to the internet.  
* **Out of Scope for v1 (Planned Future Development):**  
  * **Full CAD/3D Design Integrations:** Advanced integrations with CAD/3D design software are planned for future releases to offer more sophisticated proposal visualizations.  
  * **Marketplace for Solar Components:** A dedicated marketplace for solar components is envisioned to streamline the procurement process for installers.  
  * **Advanced Payment Processing/Billing Integrations:** More sophisticated payment processing and billing integrations are planned for v2 to enhance financial management.  
  * **SMS Gateway:** Future integration of an SMS gateway is planned to send automated lead notifications and other critical alerts to users.  
  * **Access Audit Logs and Team Performance Analytics:** These features are planned for post-MVP stages to provide administrators with deeper insights into user activity and team performance.  
  * **AI Prompt Editing for Admin (Pro tier feature):** A feature allowing administrators to directly edit AI prompts will be introduced for Pro tier subscribers, offering greater customization and control.  
  * **Language Localisation of Proposal Text:** Future plans include the localization of proposal text into additional languages such as Afrikaans, Zulu, and other regional languages to further enhance global reach.  
  * **Persona-based Prompt Variation:** The platform will offer persona-based prompt variations (e.g., Enterprise vs. SME tone) to tailor communication style to different client types.  
  * **Quote Follow-up Workflow with Auto Email/SMS (Pro tier feature):** A comprehensive quote follow-up workflow with automated email and SMS capabilities will be available for Pro tier users to improve conversion rates.  
  * **Addressing Known Issues:** Ongoing development will address known issues such as technician sync conflicts when two jobs are updated offline simultaneously and the absence of a dark mode for the mobile dashboard, ensuring a smoother user experience.

The scope of HelioSuite's development will continually evolve, driven by valuable user feedback and market performance insights gathered post-pilot, ensuring the platform remains responsive to the needs of its growing user base.
